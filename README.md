## Description: 📃
Project involves the construction of a hand-operated arcade game containing a joystick and a keypad that are used to control a game implemented on a website.
## Objective: 🎯
Physical activities are important to stay healthy but children and adults sometimes need more soothing and fun ways to do so. An arcade game not only provides a means to relaxing but it can improve cognitive abilities in children, improve reflexes and muscle memory, and also helps reduce stress and depression.
## Functionality: 🔧
Joystick and Keypad control the player movements in the game. Buzzer is used to send game alert sounds, and keypad can have a generic menu selection functionality.
Movements on the physical components are translated on the game online to complete the game objective.
